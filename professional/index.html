	<h2>Communication</h2>
	<p>Communication between team members throughout the entire project was done mostly through Facebook Messenger, which although probably
  wasn't the most Agile choice or the best choice for collecting proof, We found that it was very handy, since we all had a Facebook account
  and staying in contact with each other was achieved easily. Whenever we encountered a problem, we would post to the other members of the
  team, and we could combine efforts to help each other with issues we were having with the project.</p>
  
  <p>While we weren't using Facebook Messenger, we either communicated about our issues clearly in class, or held scrums every Tuesday,
  Thursday, and sometimes Friday. We found that having a scrum on these times, rather than every day helped a lot. We trialed having a scrum
  every day at the beginning of the semester, but found that we didn't have much to update each scrum, and that the timetables between our classes
  didn't line up well every day, which turned out to be slightly annoying having to come into polytech to have a scrum, thus we cut the scrums back
  to only Tuesdays and Thursdays, also having a scrum on Friday if we were dealing with issues that had us stuck.</p>
  
  <p>We did however have a few downfalls when it came to communication. Some issues that our team members had turned out to be far more difficult
  than we had originally thought, and the team was not notified about the team member having trouble figuring out the issue until we had little to
  no time implementing the issue into our project.</p>
  
  <h2>Leadership</h2>
  <p>Throughout the project, I didn't exactly feel like I was leading the team, rather providing help and making sure everyone had everything finished
  in time for the client to preview it before the Sprints were due. However, I've been told by my team members that if we had a definite leader, I would
  have been it. I didn't see myself as that at all.</p>
  
  <p>During the project, I did find myself having to speak to a few team members, mostly to provide help, however there were a few times where I had
  to speak to them regarding getting the Sprints done on time, since I noticed a few were being a bit slack with getting the work done. I personally
  don't like having to confront my team members like this, but I felt like it was necessary in order to make sure we actually had a project done to a
  reasonable standard.</p>
