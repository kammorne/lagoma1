	<h2>Communication</h2>
	<p>Communication between team members throughout the entire project was done mostly through Facebook Messenger, which although probably
	wasn't the most Agile choice or the best choice for collecting proof, We found that it was very handy, since we all had a Facebook account
	and staying in contact with each other was achieved easily. Whenever we encountered a problem, we would post to the other members of the
	team, and we could combine efforts to help each other with issues we were having with the project.</p>

	<p>While we weren't using Facebook Messenger, we either communicated about our issues clearly in class, or held scrums every Tuesday,
	Thursday, and sometimes Friday. We found that having a scrum on these times, rather than every day helped a lot. We trialed having a scrum
	every day at the beginning of the semester, but found that we didn't have much to update each scrum, and that the timetables between our classes
	didn't line up well every day, which turned out to be slightly annoying having to come into polytech to have a scrum, thus we cut the scrums back
	to only Tuesdays and Thursdays, also having a scrum on Friday if we were dealing with issues that had us stuck.</p>

	<p>We did however have a few downfalls when it came to communication. Some issues that our team members had turned out to be far more difficult
	than we had originally thought, and the team was not notified about the team member having trouble figuring out the issue until we had little to
	no time implementing the issue into our project.</p>

	<h2>Leadership</h2>
	<p>Throughout the project, I didn't exactly feel like I was leading the team, rather providing help and making sure everyone had everything finished
	in time for the client to preview it before the Sprints were due. However, I've been told by my team members that if we had a definite leader, I would
	have been it. I didn't see myself as that at all.</p>

	<p>During the project, I did find myself having to speak to a few team members, mostly to provide help, however there were a few times where I had
	to speak to them regarding getting the Sprints done on time, since I noticed a few were being a bit slack with getting the work done. I personally
	don't like having to confront my team members like this, but I felt like it was necessary in order to make sure we actually had a project done to a
	reasonable standard.</p>

	<h2>Team Work</h2>
	<p>As mentioned above, we maintained a high level of teamwork throughout the project's development. If we encountered any issues with our software,
	we ended up contacting each other through Facebook Messenger, and we were able to help each other with the issues we were having.</p>
	
	<p>Personally, I found myself providing help to others quite a bit throughout the project's development. Especially during the conversion to the
	laravel framework. Because both Nick and I had done the tutorial for learning laravel, and both of us had worked on the very first version of the
	Edit Semesters page, we both had to provide help to our fellow members when it came to moving all of our previous work into the laravel framework.
	The only problem I found with this is that I ended up having to leave a few of my issues I was working on to provide help to the team members which
	were struggling, which in the end didn't cause too much hassle with our team, but I'm aware of other teams having problems not finishing their Sprints
	on time because they were helping other team members with their issues instead.</p>
