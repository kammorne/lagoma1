	<p>This portfolio contains all information regarding the development of the Semester Tracker that we were assigned for the
	IN602 Software Engineering Course. I've compiled all my experiences into different tabs along the left hand side of the site,
	as well as my CV.</p>
	
	<p>These experiences are my own experiences, and hopefully they provide insight on what both myself and my team have gone through,
	both highs and lows, in order to finish our project by the end of the Semester.</p>
